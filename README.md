# Holy Chat (Collaborative Study Platform Website Project)

## Description
Holy Chat is a real-time chat application that allows users to manage groups and communicate efficiently.

## Backstory
For our finals project in Software Development 1, we were given choices in what kind of website we'll have to make. We decided that we're going to make a Collaborative Study Platform website project. I developed the entire website, including both backend and frontend, implementing all of its functionality. My teammates contributed only to the presentation, as the coding and technical implementation were beyond their current skill set.
